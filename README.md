## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Hello

This is the Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data Course,  Course 3 in Coursera Data Science Specialization


### Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a data science aspirant ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`, provides the overview of the whole project.
- `cleandata.txt`, which contains the gidy data as requested.
- `CodeBook.md`, indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
- `run_analysis.R`, the analysis script that contains the code used to complete this course and peer assignment 

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

Use the run_analysis.R file to
1. Download the data from the url provided in the course assignment instrcution
2. The code will create the appropraite directory to download the data and will also unzip them
3. The code will then perform steps 4 to 8
4. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
8. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
